## Different types of sensor networks. 
```sh
	1) Stationary sensor networks 
	2) mobile sensor networks
	3) mobile sensor networks
		Aerial mobile sensor networks: the mobile networks which move
	4) terrestrial sensor networks: sensor networks that move in the space
	5) underwater sensor networks: nodes basically move in the underwater area.
```

Nodes have to cooperate with one another to function with each other.
